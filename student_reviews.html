                <h1>Gowtham GM</h1>
                <p> A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team. I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. 
                    I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different.
                     The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in 
                    learning programming languages from scratch.</p><br>
                
                    <p>I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that
                         makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. 
                        The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</p>

                <p>After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved.
                     Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.</p><br>

                <p>Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos.
                     They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.</p><br>
                
                <p>I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.</p><br>

                <p>I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in Tamil 
                    Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a free course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other 
                    academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner,
                    start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS concepts,
                    highly valuable for placement opportunities. I'm grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer
                    with a package of 5 LPA through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, 
                    as I used the same approach they taught me during them mock interview process. Additionally, Tap Academy offers 
                    comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform with daily class recordings, a TAl platform for practicing
                    daily programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock assessments and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, 
                    as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical thinking.
